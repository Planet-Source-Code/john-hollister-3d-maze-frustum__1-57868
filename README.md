### Description

3D "maze" doesn't really have an ending.. but it serves another purpose. This is a cell&portals maze. It uses exact visibility ( recursion ) and clipping to create a view of the maze. I originally had to do this in C++.net using openGL. This USES PURE VB. only a few api calls. I'm looking for someone who has a good idea for a maze building algorithm so i can do some file I/O. right now i just build the maze in the program which takes up A LOT of lines, and could be done much easier by reading a file. anyway, leave your comments, learn, enjoy.
